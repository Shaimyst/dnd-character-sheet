# starting with ideas for a project (only from users perspective)

# 1. a tool to help with building a character sheet for a tabletop roleplaying game

# for a character sheet, we need to be able to store the following information:
# - name
# - race
# - class
# - level
# - background
# - alignment
# - experience points
# - inspiration
# - proficiencies
# - equipment
# - features and traits
# - spells and abilities
# - other notes

# generate a character sheet based on the information we have
# print out the character sheet
# save the character sheet to a file
# load a character sheet from a file
# update the character sheet

# we need to be able to store the character sheets in a database?


# let's expand on the background
# background is the history of the character, including their past, their motivations, and their goals
# background is important because it can affect the character's abilities and flaws
# for example, a character with the "Acolyte" background has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened
# a character with the "Charlatan" background has advantage on deceptions and persuasion checks
# a character with the "Criminal" background has advantage on sleight of hand and stealth checks
# a character with the "Entertainer" background has advantage on acrobatics and performance checks
# a character with the "Folk Hero" background has advantage on athletics and persuasion checks
# a character with the "Guild Artisan" background has advantage on insight and intimidation checks
# a character with the "Hermit" background has advantage on medicine and religion checks
# a character with the "Noble" background has advantage on intimidation and persuasion checks
# a character with the "Outlander" background has advantage on athletics and survival checks
# a character with the "Sage" background has advantage on arcana and history checks
# a character with the "Sailor" background has advantage on athletics and perception checks
# a character with the "Soldier" background has advantage on athletics and intimidation checks

# the tool should provide examples of what they value, what they believe in, and what they fear
# for example, a character with the "Acolyte" background values order and tradition, and believes in the importance of following rules and laws
# a character with the "Charlatan" background values money and power, and believes that the ends justify the means
# a character with the "Criminal" background values freedom and revenge, and believes that the law is corrupt and needs to be overthrown
# a character with the "Entertainer" background values creativity and self-expression, and believes that everyone should be able to express themselves freely
# a character with the "Folk Hero" background values community and tradition, and believes that everyone should work together to create a better society
# a character with the "Guild Artisan" background values craftsmanship and tradition, and believes that everyone should be able to support themselves through their skills
# a character with the "Hermit" background values knowledge and solitude, and believes that the only way to truly understand the world is to be alone with your thoughts
# a character with the "Noble" background values honor and duty, and believes that everyone should be able to live in freedom and safety
# a character with the "Outlander" background values freedom and exploration, and believes that the world is a dangerous place that needs to be constantly explored and understood
# a character with the "Sage" background values knowledge and learning, and believes that the only way to truly understand the world is to learn from it
# a character with the "Sailor" background values loyalty and camaraderie, and believes that the only way to truly understand the world is to be with others who are also exploring it
# a character with the "Soldier" background values strength and discipline, and believes that the only way to truly understand the world is to be strong and disciplined


# 2. a tool for rolling dice

# 3. a tool for generating random names

# 4. a tool for generating random locations

# 5. a tool for generating random items

# stating the minimum viable product
# the tool should be able to generate a character sheet based on the information we have
# the tool should be able to print out the character sheet

# this should be web based
# streamlit is a good choice for this


# next steps:
# tech choices:
# 1. poetry for dependency management
# 2. streamlit for the web app
# 3. pipenv for the virtual environment

# get started with streamlit
